# BMI---calculator
A quick messy program written for fun during my science classes back in the day to calculate your BMI value in Metric.


# What i learnt from this
I think as a "programmer" its allways best to program something new you are learning or may not understand esspeically in subjects 
such as science or maths, this will help with your understanding simply due to the fact that to write a program of it you must 
understand it.
